<br>Monster High is back in session, 
<br>and Deuce Gorgon doll looks as scaretastic as ever! 
<br>As the son of Medusa, Deuce Gorgon is without a doubt the ghoul-est 
<br>guy around, and he certainly looks the part in his bespoke denim jacket 
<br>and graphic tee. His snake-engraved shades are not only uber cool, but prevent 
<br>him from turning people into stone with his gaze -- talk about stone-cold style! 
<br>With his loyal pet mouse Perseus at his side, Deuce Gorgon is more than ready for 
<br>a spooktacular time. Doll cannot stand alone. Colors and decorations may vary.
