School is back in session,<br>
and the Monster High ghouls are showing up<br>
in scream-tastic style! Draculaura doll<br>
struts down the Monster High hallways<br>
in a fang-tastic fashion featuring heart-print<br>
shorts and a vampy corset blouse with sheer sleeves.<br>
Her freaky-fabulous, vampire-inspired look is<br>
complete with sheer, ruffled stockings, pink platform shoes,<br>
and a headband and sunglasses with batty details.<br>
Take Draculaura doll's look to the next level with a scary-chic<br>
cape and accessories. And inspire spooktacular<br>
storytelling with her creepy-cute pet bat, Count Fabulous! Doll cannot<br>
stand alone. Colors and decorations may vary.<br>
