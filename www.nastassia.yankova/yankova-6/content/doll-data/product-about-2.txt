<br>School is back in session, and the Monster High ghouls 
<br>are showing up in scream-tastic style! Lagoona Blue doll 
<br>struts down the Monster High hallways in a fin-tastic fashion 
<br>featuring a hot-pink hoodie with mesh sleeves and a trendy, 
<br>tie-dye bike shorts romper. Her gore-geous look is complete with 
<br>a sea monster-inspired waist bag, seashell backpack, colorblock 
<br>platform sandals and freaky-fabulous fin details inspired by her 
<br>unique scaritage. Switch up Lagoona Blue doll's look with a "metallic,
<br>" fish scale-detailed swimsuit, and inspire spooktacular storytelling 
<br>with fearsome accessories and her creepy-cute pet fish, Neptuna! 
<br>Doll cannot stand alone. Colors and decorations may vary.
